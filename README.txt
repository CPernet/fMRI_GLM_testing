This repo contains a series of script to investigate how to best model the BOLD signal
given various configuration of neural activity

the work is motivated by Grinband et al. (2008). 
Detection of time-varying signals in event-related fMRI designs. NeuroImage, 43, 509-520
and the following work done by Mumford (2014) Adjusting mean activation for reaction time 
effects in BOLD fMRI. OHBM poster.

it also started from a paper by R. Poldrack see
